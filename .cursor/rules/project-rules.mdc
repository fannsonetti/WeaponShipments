# Cursor Project Rules (Lightweight)

## Scope

* Only implement what I ask for.
* Don't build future features unless requested.
* If something feels out of scope, ask first.

## Files

* Prefer editing or renaming existing files.
* If you think a new file is needed, briefly explain why before creating it.
* Don't create lots of small files for minor features.

## Renames

* If something is being renamed, just rename it and update references.
* Don't rewrite working logic unless you're asked.

## Player-Facing Content

* No "Act 1/Act 2" labels in UI or dialogue.
* Only quest names and objectives should be visible to players.
* Keep UI text clean and intentional.

## Flow Rules (Project-Specific)

* Warehouse cannot be purchased before Quest 1 is complete.
* Property ownership unlock comes from the Agent 28 quest.
* No warehouse purchase card unless explicitly requested.
* Weapon manufacturing must remain locked until the proper quest unlocks it.

## When Unsure

* Ask instead of guessing.
* Keep changes minimal.
* Avoid silent architectural changes.

## S1API

* Always use the [IfBars S1API fork](https://github.com/ifBars/S1API). Reference the local DLL from the fork, not the original KaBooMa/Official package.

## Output Preference

* Briefly explain what files you're touching.
* Keep explanations short.
* Don't over-explain.
