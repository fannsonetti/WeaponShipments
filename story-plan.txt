Got it — thanks for calling that out. I’ll keep the **exact same quest setup format** we were using before and only change **Act 2’s contents**, not the structure or tone.

Below is the **corrected version**, slotting your new idea cleanly into the existing framework.

---

# FINAL MAIN QUEST STRUCTURE (CORRECTED)

---

## **Act 1 — Quest 1**

### **New Number, New Problems**

**What happens**

* You receive a message from an unknown number
* You agree to work with him
* Agent 28 contacts you from his real phone
* You meet him in the black market
* Property ownership is unlocked

**Why it works**

* Clear inciting incident
* Introduces Agent 28 properly
* Ends with a permanent system unlock

---

## **Act 2 — Quest 2**

### **Starting Small** *(Reworked, same format)*

**What happens**

* You are told to find **one person you can trust**
* You hire **Archie**:

  * Main weapon maker
  * Former cartel worker
* Archie explains you don’t have the equipment needed to actually make anything
* He tells you the cartel controls local supply
* Archie gives you the location of a **cartel manor**
* You raid the manor and **steal a truck full of weapon-manufacturing equipment**
* You deliver the truck back to the warehouse

**State change**

* Weapon manufacturing is unlocked
* The cartel is now implicitly introduced into the story

**Why it works**

* Act 2 now has real action and consequence
* Archie is narratively important before his death
* The cartel is seeded early without forcing a war

---

## **Act 3 — Quest 3**

### **Unpacking**

**What happens**

* You go to the warehouse when you are ready
* You unpack everything out of the van onto the floor

**Why it works**

* Clear transitional moment after delivery
* Sets up production readiness

---

## **Act 4 — Quest 4**

### **Moving Up**

**What happens**

* The warehouse reaches its limits
* You move operations to the garage
* Production increases significantly
* Things feel stable and efficient

**Why it works**

* Clear sense of growth
* Sets up false security before the fall

---

## **Act 5 — Quest 5**

### **Burned**

**What happens**

* A full police task force raids the garage
* This is not a normal raid
* The garage is permanently seized
* **Archie is killed** while covering your escape

**State change**

* You lose your main base
* You lose your weapon maker
* This is irreversible

**Why it works**

* Major emotional and mechanical pivot
* Justifies the bunker as a necessity

---

## **Act 6 — Quest 6**

### **Taking Control**

**What happens**

* Agent 28 reveals the weapons-smuggling bunker
* He explains it’s owned by the same cartel
* Branch check:

  * If the cartel is already defeated → proceed
  * If not → defeat the cartel first
* You raid the bunker
* You clear it and claim it as your new base


## **Act 7 — Quest 7**

### **No Going Back**

**What happens**

* You establish bunker operations
* Agent 28 confirms the new reality:

  * No permanent surface bases
* You fully commit to operating underground
